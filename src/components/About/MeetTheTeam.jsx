    bio: `Hi, I'm Minty! I love boxing 🥊. 1 of my bucket list items was fighting in the ring, which I actually ticked off ✅. I'm 1 of the very few people who hasn't ever watched Avatar, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter 🤯. My favorite jobs are fixing brakes, which is why people like to call me Mintex. I got my nickname Minty because I'm always late (after eight) ✨.`,

    bio: `Hi I'm Jon! I look rough and ready but deep down I'm a bit of a geek 🧠. I like PC gaming and unlike Minty I have watched Avatar, Lord of the Rings and all the Harry Potter films 🎥. 🧍‍♂️ I guess I'm a part time raver. Occasionally I put down the spanner and hit up festivals and raves with my Mrs and friends. Ps I'll 1 v 1 on (fav game) for a free service.`,
