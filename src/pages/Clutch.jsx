                        A clutch allows the driver to engage and disengage the engine from the transmission. When you press the clutch pedal, the engine is disconnected from the transmission, which allows you to change gears or stop without stalling the engine. Releasing the clutch reconnects the engine to the transmission, allowing the car to move again
