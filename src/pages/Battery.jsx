                        Car batteries are essential for starting your vehicle and powering its electrical systems. A healthy battery ensures reliable engine starts, especially in extreme weather conditions, and powers components like lights, radio, and electronic systems when the engine is off. Here's a guide to understanding and maintaining your car battery:

                        A car battery provides the electrical energy needed to start the engine and powers various electronics when the engine isnâ€™t running. Once the engine starts, the alternator takes over to recharge the battery and provide power to the electrical systems.
